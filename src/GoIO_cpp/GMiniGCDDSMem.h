// Declare the GMiniGCDDSRec structure. This is the memory record stored on a Vernier Mini Gas Chromatograph that is readable 
// and writeable from a host computer. The GMiniGCDDSRec stucture is a variant of the GSensorDDSRec.
//
// The GMiniGCDDSRec is used as a shared memory communication area. Fields in the record can be modified by
// the host computer or by the GC. This means that some sort of locking mechanism is required to keep the record coherent.
// Once the host computer has written the first byte of the GMiniGCDDSRec, the GC should regard the GMiniGCDDSRec as
// incoherent until the last byte of the GMiniGCDDSRec(the checksum) has been written.
// Similarly, once the host computer has read the first byte of the GMiniGCDDSRec, the GC should not alter the contents of
// GMiniGCDDSRec until the last byte(the checksum) has been read. The host computer is required to read and write the
// entire GMiniGCDDSRec in discrete chunks. This is accomplished via GoIO_Sensor_DDSMem_ReadRecord() and
// GoIO_Sensor_DDSMem_WriteRecord().
// 
// Most of the fields in the GMiniGCDDSRec are written only by the host computer, the GC does not alter them. These
// fields should be read back by the host computer with same values last written by the computer.
//
// The fields in the structure that are declared as shorts and floats are stored on the chromatograph in little endian
// format. These same fields are typically manipulated on a host computer in platform specific endian format,
// eg. little endian for Wintel machines, and big endian for Power PC Macs, so marshalling is performed.
//
// Note that we are also assuming that the platform specific implementaton of float is 4 bytes long(we ASSERT this)
// and IEEE compliant.

//For languages that do not support packed 'C' structures directly, eg Basic, applications can access fields in the 
//GMiniGCDDSRec directly using the GoIO_Sensor_DDSMem_Set... and GoIO_Sensor_DDSMem_Get... functions.
//GMiniGCDDSRec is carefully laid out to match GSensorDDSRec so that all these functions work on both records.
//The new fields specific to the GMiniGCDDSRec correspond to fields in the GCalibrationPages, so they can all be
//accessed via the GoIO_Sensor_DDSMem_SetCalPage() and GoIO_Sensor_DDSMem_GetCalPage() functions.
//The new GMiniGCDDSRec fields map to the GSensorDDSRec fields as follows:
//	GMiniGCDDSRec.CalibrationCoefficientA maps to GSensorDDSRec.CalibrationPage[0].CalibrationCoefficientA.
//	GMiniGCDDSRec.CalibrationCoefficientB maps to GSensorDDSRec.CalibrationPage[0].CalibrationCoefficientB.
//	GMiniGCDDSRec.ColumnTemperature maps to GSensorDDSRec.CalibrationPage[0].CalibrationCoefficientC.
//	GMiniGCDDSRec.Units maps to GSensorDDSRec.CalibrationPage[0].Units.
//	GMiniGCDDSRec.StartTemperature maps to GSensorDDSRec.CalibrationPage[1].CalibrationCoefficientA.
//	GMiniGCDDSRec.HoldTime1 maps to GSensorDDSRec.CalibrationPage[1].CalibrationCoefficientB.
//	GMiniGCDDSRec.RampRate maps to GSensorDDSRec.CalibrationPage[1].CalibrationCoefficientC.
//	GMiniGCDDSRec.Status maps to GSensorDDSRec.CalibrationPage[1].Units.
//	GMiniGCDDSRec.FinalTemperature maps to GSensorDDSRec.CalibrationPage[2].CalibrationCoefficientA.
//	GMiniGCDDSRec.HoldTime2 maps to GSensorDDSRec.CalibrationPage[2].CalibrationCoefficientB.
//	GMiniGCDDSRec.PressureSetting maps to GSensorDDSRec.CalibrationPage[2].CalibrationCoefficientC.
//	GMiniGCDDSRec.PressureReading maps to GSensorDDSRec.CalibrationPage[2].Units[0..3].
//	GMiniGCDDSRec.Spare maps to GSensorDDSRec.CalibrationPage[2].Units[4..6].
//So, for example, you can modify StartTemperature, HoldTime1, RampRate, and Status with the following call:
//	GoIO_Sensor_DDSMem_SetCalPage(hSensor, 1, newStartTemperature, newHoldTime1, newRampRate, newStatus);
